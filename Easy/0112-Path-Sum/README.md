# 0112 Path Sum

## Solution1.java

Solution 1 is the basic recursive solution.

## Solution2.java

Solution 2 is the refined version of solution 1 with more elegant code, which is similar to 0111.

## Solution3.java

Solution 3 is the most concise solution.  But at first, I thought it was wrong.  It turns out that the order of the three statements is very significant.
