# 0299 Bulls and Cows

## Solution1.java

Solution 1 is my solution which traverses the string for 3 times.  When I first try to solve this problem, I made a serious mistake---I tried to find `nCow` online.  Actually, that's not possible.

## Solution2.java

Solution 2 pay some extra space for faster speed.  The use of `min` is very impressive.
