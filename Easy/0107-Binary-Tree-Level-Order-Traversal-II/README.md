# 0107 Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II

## Solution1.java

Solution 1 is the basic implementation of BFS solution.

## Solution2.java

Solution 2 is the basic implementation of DFS solution.

## Solution3.java

Solution 3 is the refined version of Solution 2 which eliminates the `Collections.reverse` operation.

## Solution4.java

Solution 4 is the refined version of Solution 1 which uses `levelNum` to implicitly get depth instead of an inner class to explicitly store depth.  And it also eliminates `Collections.reverse` operation.
