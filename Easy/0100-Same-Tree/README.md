## Solution1.java

Solution 1 is the implementation of recursive solution.

## Solution2.java

Solution 2 is the implementation of iterative solution.  By using two stacks, we actually simulate the process of recursive solution.

## Note

The iterative solution performs worse than the recursive solution.
